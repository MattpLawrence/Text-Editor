## Description:

A PWA text editor that can run offline.

### -Motivation:

The motivation behind this project was to create a text editor for writing code in that could be used through the browser or as downloaded and used offline as a PWA.

### -What was Learned:

I learned how to set up Progressive Web Applications in a way that they can be used offline and retain information. This application uses a cache for data retention while offline, and the browser's database otherwise.
